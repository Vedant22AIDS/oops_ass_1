    "1. **Access Control:**\n",
    "   - **Public:** Members (attributes or methods) declared as public are accessible from outside the class. They form the interface through which external code interacts with the class. Public members are essential for allowing other classes or objects to use the functionality provided by the class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **Private:** Members declared as private are only accessible within the class itself. They are hidden from external access, providing a level of security and preventing direct manipulation of the internal state by external entities. Private members are typically accessed and modified through public methods, allowing the class to control and validate the interactions with its internal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Protected:** Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and its subclasses (derived classes). This allows for a controlled level of access, enabling the subclass to inherit and use certain members while still restricting direct access from external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Hiding:**\n",
    "   - Data hiding involves restricting the access to the internal details of an object. The internal state (attributes or properties) of an object should not be directly accessible from outside the class. Instead, external code should interact with the object through well-defined interfaces provided by public methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   - By hiding the implementation details, a class can maintain a stable external interface while making changes to its internal structure without affecting the external code that uses it. This concept promotes code flexibility, as modifications to the internal implementation do not necessitate changes to the code outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, encapsulation, through access control and data hiding, helps in creating modular and secure code by managing the visibility and accessibility of class members. It promotes the principle of information hiding, where the internal details of a class are concealed, and interactions are conducted through a well-defined and controlled interface. This enhances code organization, reusability, and maintenance in the context of object-oriented programming.\n",

    "Increased Complexity: Encapsulation can introduce additional complexity to the codebase, especially\n",
    "when getter and setter methods are used extensively. This complexity can make the code harder to read\n",
    "and maintain, particularly in large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que18\n",
    "Code Organization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation organizes code by grouping related data and behavior into classes. This organization \n",
    "makes the code more structured and easier to understand, as each class represents a self-contained \n",
    "module with a well-defined purpose. This modular structure simplifies the overall design of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation provides abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only\n",
    "a well-defined interface to the outside world. This abstraction allows developers to use classes\n",
    "without needing to understand their internal complexities. By interacting with the public interface,\n",
    "developers can focus on the high-level functionality, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Hiding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation supports the concept of information hiding, where the internal details of a class are \n",
    "hidden from external code. Private attributes and methods can only be accessed within the class, \n",
    "preventing external entities from directly manipulating the internal state. This separation of \n",
    "concerns reduces the risk of unintended consequences and enhances the stability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "Encapsulation promotes code reusability by creating modular components that can be easily reused in \n",
    "different parts of a program or in entirely different projects. Once a class is defined with a clear \n",
    "and well-documented interface, it can be instantiated and used wherever needed without the need to \n",
    "understand its internal implementation. This promotes the development of reusable and shareable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Que19\n",
    "**Information hiding** is a concept closely associated with encapsulation in object-oriented programming. It refers to the practice of restricting the visibility of certain details of a class or module and exposing only what is necessary for the external world to interact with it. In other words, information hiding involves hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing a well-defined and limited interface to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are key aspects of information hiding within the context of encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Private Members:**\n",
    "   - Information hiding is often implemented by marking certain members (attributes or methods) of a class as private. These private members can only be accessed and modified from within the class itself, preventing external code from directly manipulating the internal state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Public Interface:**\n",
    "   - The public interface of a class consists of those members that are accessible from outside the class. These members serve as the contract between the class and external code. By exposing a well-defined public interface, a class can provide access to its functionality while keeping the implementation details hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction:**\n",
    "   - Information hiding facilitates abstraction by allowing developers to use a class without needing to understand its internal workings. Abstraction emphasizes the essential features of an object while suppressing unnecessary details. This makes code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security and Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Information hiding enhances security by controlling access to sensitive data and operations. Private members are shielded from direct external access, reducing the risk of unintended modifications. Encapsulation, through information hiding, helps create a clear separation between the external interface and the internal implementation, adding a layer of security to the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Flexibility and Maintenance:**\n",
    "   - By hiding implementation details, information hiding provides flexibility in modifying and updating the internal structure of a class. Changes to the internal implementation can be made without affecting the external code that relies on the class's interface. This separation simplifies maintenance and updates, as modifications can be localized to the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is information hiding essential in software development?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity and Maintainability:**\n",
    "   - Information hiding promotes modularity by encapsulating related functionalities within individual units (classes or modules). This modular design makes it easier to maintain and update code because changes to one module are less likely to impact other parts of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Hiding unnecessary details reduces the complexity of the code seen by external users. Developers can focus on using the provided interfaces without being overwhelmed by the intricacies of the internal implementation. This results in simpler and more understandable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Stability:**\n",
    "   - Information hiding enhances code stability by protecting the internal state of objects. External code cannot inadvertently disrupt the internal consistency of objects since they are required to interact through well-defined and controlled interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security:**\n",
    "   - By restricting access to sensitive information, information hiding contributes to the security of a program. It prevents unintended interference and manipulation of critical data, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Reusability:**\n",
    "   - Classes with well-defined interfaces and hidden implementation details are more likely to be reusable in various contexts. Other developers can confidently use these classes without concerns about unintended side effects or dependencies on internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, information hiding is essential in software development as it promotes modularity, maintainability, reduced complexity, code stability, security, and code reusability. It enables developers to build robust and flexible systems by creating clear boundaries between the internal implementation of a class and its external interface.\n",
